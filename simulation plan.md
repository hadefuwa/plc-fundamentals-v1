Interactive Simulation Plan for CP2388 Scenarios

Troubleshooting & Fault-Finding PLC Fundamentals Systems

Scenario 1 – Titanium Forging

1. Cold start condition: Simulate flow not starting due to low temperature; learner must investigate temperature cut-out or offset.
2. Sensor offset explorer: Show actual temp is 25 °C but HMI reads 4 °C; learner checks analogue input scaling/offset.

Scenario 2 – Pharmaceutical Plant

1. Blocked flow fault: Pump at 100%, no flow. Learner identifies valve stuck closed or sensor offset.
2. Pump speed vs flow mismatch: Visualise pump running but no pulses from flow sensor – simulate turbine jam or signal wire issue.

Scenario 3 – CNC Machines Factory Cooling

1. Turbulence diagnostic: Show irregular behaviour (e.g. flow sensor showing spikes); learner explores unstable PID.
2. Condensation clue simulator: Use animated return line to visually show abnormal flow vs reported values.

Feedback from colleauge:

✅ General Strengths of the Plan
Strong Maintenance Focus: Nearly all simulations relate to diagnostics, system behaviour, and fault detection — ideal for real-world maintenance contexts.

Progressive Skill Building: Starts with visualisation (e.g. LED, HMI feedback), then advances into more complex sensor diagnostics and system-level faults.

Consistent Toolset: IO screen, HMI mimic, fault injection, and manual resets are used throughout — excellent for skill transfer to actual industrial settings.

Redundancy & Safety Themes: E-Stop channels, sensor fail-safes, and cut-out logic are well-covered — critical for industrial learners.

🔧 Targeted Recommendations (CP2388)
Worksheet 1 – PLC Fundamentals
✅ Good.

✅ Suggestion: Add a “setpoint unreachable” simulation, forcing the user to identify why the system can't stabilise despite PID efforts.

Worksheet 2 – Emergency Stop
✅ Strong focus on redundancy and reset.

✅ Suggestion: Add a “contact bounce simulation” – show how poor Estop switch condition causes flicker on IO screen.

Worksheet 3 – Status LED
✅ LED-state mapping is excellent.

✅ Suggestion: Let learners "label" the LED behaviour based on system state (normal, fault, Estop, sensor fail).

Worksheet 4 – PLC
✅ Great use of simulated I/O.

✅ Suggestion: Include a “timed pulse counter” where learners must diagnose whether a digital input is pulsing correctly (e.g. flow sensor).

Worksheet 5 – HMI
✅ Covers key features.

✅ Suggestion: Add a "missing fault" scenario — fault is active in IO, but learner must identify it without HMI alarm showing (HMI fault screen disabled).

Worksheet 6 – Pump
✅ Very practical.

✅ Suggestion: Include a “motor run current” overlay, showing excessive demand when dry running or blocked. Relates well to real-world maintenance clues.

Worksheet 7 – Valve
✅ Valve control and behaviour logic covered.

✅ Suggestion: Add “fail open vs fail closed” mode selector, so learners observe different safety outcomes during Estop.

Worksheet 8 – Float Switch
✅ NO vs NC well covered.

✅ Suggestion: Add a “vibration test” — simulate float bouncing on turbulent water, show IO flicker, learner must explain need for debounce logic.

Worksheet 9 – Proximity Switch
✅ Excellent.

✅ Suggestion: Include EM interference overlay or misalignment over time due to vibration — shows real-life drift/fault causes.

Worksheet 10 – Flow Sensor
✅ Sensor simulation is sound.

✅ Suggestion: Add "reverse flow detection" scenario (e.g. water backfeeds post-shutdown); flow sensor may still show pulses.

Worksheet 11 – Temperature Sensor
✅ Very useful.

✅ Suggestion: Show "sensor drift over time" (e.g. sensor reading slowly climbing despite stable water); learner must decide when recalibration is needed.

Worksheet 12 – Digital Sensors
✅ All covered well.

✅ Suggestion: Add “label the IO” activity – learners identify each digital input by toggling real-world actions (press Estop, lift float, etc).

Worksheet 13 – Analogue Sensors
✅ Signal scaling is critical.

✅ Suggestion: Include “sensor swap” simulation — learner swaps in 0–300 °C sensor, must rescale the analogue input.

Worksheet 14 – Faults
✅ Brilliant set.

✅ Suggestion: Add "report writing" module where learner generates fault report (timestamp, symptom, diagnosis, resolution).

🔧 CP2388 Suggestions (Maintenance)
Overall, excellent structure. Each one works well with IO and signal-tracing. Consider these enhancements:

Global Enhancements
✅ Maintenance Skill Tie-In: Each fault sim should explicitly reference:

Symptom identification

Source isolation

Corrective action

✅ Add Equipment Behaviour Feedback: E.g. simulate sounds, vibration, heat — help learners diagnose without just IO.
