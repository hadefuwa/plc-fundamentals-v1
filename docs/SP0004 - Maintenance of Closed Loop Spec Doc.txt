Product Description 
The Industrial Maintenance PLC Fundamentals PID Control System (Model IM6390) is a hands-on industrial training solution designed to teach fault diagnosis, system behaviour analysis, and component-level troubleshooting in a real-world flow control environment.
It includes a Siemens S7-1200 PLC, Unified Basic HMI, turbine flow sensor, proportional control valve, analogue flow gauge, IFM temperature sensor, float switches, and a proximity sensor, simulating industrial process equipment. Learners engage with hands-on experiments involving general system use and fault simulation, and sensor validation. 
The system operates via a closed-loop feedback structure: the PLC adjusts both the valve and pump output using a PID algorithm to maintain a target flow rate, with real-time sensor feedback displayed on the HMI. The product includes a full curriculum of guided worksheets focused on closed-loop control theory, component diagnostics, and fault scenarios.

Electrical Safety Information
The Industrial Maintenance PLC Fundamentals PID Control System (Model IM6390) is designed with safety in mind and complies with relevant low-voltage and EMC standards. Users must adhere to the following safety guidance to ensure safe and correct operation.
Key Safety Notes
* Low Voltage Operation:
The system operates at 24V DC only. It does not require or tolerate direct connection to mains voltage. Doing so will result in damage and void the warranty.
* Power Supply:
Use only the supplied 24V power adapter with approved plug heads (UK, EU, US). The power supply is a Class II, CE-marked unit with overvoltage and short-circuit protection.
* Enclosure and Wiring:
All electrical components are mounted in a protective enclosure or DIN rail panel with finger-safe terminals. No exposed live connections are present under normal use.
* Fuse and Circuit Protection:
The system is internally protected by a Siemens 5SY MCB (3A, Curve B) to prevent overload or short-circuit damage.
Maintenance and Inspection
* Only qualified personnel should service or inspect internal wiring.
* Regularly inspect external cables for damage or wear.
* Do not modify wiring without referring to the system schematic and isolating power first.
* Always isolate power before performing any hardware fault insertion or removal of connectors.
Emergency and Fault Handling
* Simulated Emergency Stop:
The system includes a dual-channel E-Stop for educational and simulation purposes only. It is not connected to a certified safety relay or safety-rated PLC. Pressing the button will halt outputs via PLC logic, but should not be relied on for personal protection in real emergency scenarios.
* Reset Logic:
After the E-Stop is pressed, it must be manually reset (twist to release), followed by pressing the reset button on the front panel or HMI.
* Recommended Emergency Action:
In a real emergency, the most effective method to isolate the system is to switch off the rear-mounted circuit breaker or unplug the 24V DC barrel connector. This fully cuts power to all components.
* Fault LED Indicator:
A red system LED indicates a fault or simulated safety event. The system should not be operated until the issue is resolved.



Standards Compliance
This system is designed for educational and training use and incorporates industrial-grade components and wiring practices. While it follows best practices in system layout and electrical safety, it is not intended for use in operational industrial environments.
The system aligns with the following standards where applicable:
* EN 60204-1 � Electrical equipment of machines (informative compliance in wiring and protection practices)
* EN 61010-1 � Safety requirements for electrical equipment for measurement, control, and laboratory use
* Low Voltage Directive 2014/35/EU � Applicable to included power supply and components
* RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU � Restriction of hazardous substances compliance for electronic components
Note: This product is intended for educational use only and does not fall under the full scope of the Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC. The emergency stop (E-stop) function is simulated via PLC logic and is not implemented using a safety-rated relay or redundant hardware. As such, the E-stop is not compliant with BS EN 60204-1 Clause 9.2.2 and must not be relied upon for industrial safety purposes.
